Overview:
There are so many delicious places to eat in Indianapolis. Unfortunately due to COVID-19, many restaurants have found they have to close their doors on their dine-in 
services and customers feel they may have to miss out on their favorite foods or the joy of exploring new places. This summer the TechPoint team is looking to launch 
its very own Xtern food delivery service, titled The FoodieX, to ensure that all Xterns can access the amazing cuisine in the city! 
Situation: 
To properly create the food delivery service, Xternâ€™s product FoodieX will be released with all of the associated features and we need your help!
In order to make FoodieX the best delivery service in town, the data science team is focusing its efforts on analyzing the data set to provide useful insights into the business.
You can find a data set with restaurant information. The data set contains Restaurant ID, Latitude, Longitude, Cuisines, Average Cost, Minimum Order, Rating, Votes, Reviews, 
and Cook Time. 
Task:
Review the data and draw four conclusions you can find from the data set. Some ideas of conclusions could include: trying to identify the trending restaurants with your 
own scoring algorithm (can be as simple as the best rating or most votes or both!), clustering restaurant locations to figure out the optimized FoodieX pick up zones, 
estimating cook time based on restaurant info, and demonstrating your findings using a data visualization tool. As an important member of the FoodieX team, you get to come 
up with your own analysis! So try your best to dig out any useful information out of this data set. The sky's the limit!
